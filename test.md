MyHeritage DNA is a division of one of the largest genealogy sites, MyHeritage. Over 95 million people use their ancestry service and DNA testing is becoming an increasingly important part of their customers research. [MyHeritage DNA](https://www.myheritage.com/) only offers autosomal testing, which tends to be the most useful for connecting you with fairly close relatives and exploring your ethnic heritage.

An interesting comparison, because there are certain aspects of each company's offering that the other company doesn't really touch at all.

Are you interested in health testing to discover whether you may be at a genetically higher risk for certain diseases, or to learn whether you're a carrier for certain hereditary conditions you could pass to your children? If so, then 23andMe is your choice, because MyHeritage does none of the [DNA health testing](/dna-testing/dna-health-testing).

If genealogical research is your goal, though, the choice is much murkier. Mainly this is because 23andMe doesn't have much of a community at all. You'd be surprised how much more you might learn about your results by tapping into the longstanding and reputable community at MyHeritage.

It should be noted that 23andMe actually offers more [ancestry DNA tests](/dna-testing/best-dna-ancestry-test) than MyHeritage, though. That's kind of counterintuitive, isn't it? You can't get the yDNA or mtDNA test from MyHeritage. You HAVE TO buy all three if you go with 23andMe---even if you're only interested in getting the most complete picture of your ethnic heritage and finding relatives---but the price is basically the same.

**Bottom line:** If your goal is to learn about ethnic heritage and tap into a knowledgeable community, one could argue that MyHeritage wins in that case. But since MyHeritage lets you upload data from elsewhere for free, and the price of all three ancestry tests at 23andMe matches the price of just the autosomal alone at MyHeritage, that could affect your decision. And if your goals involve health testing at all, your choice should be 23andMe. Overall, edge goes to 23andMe.
